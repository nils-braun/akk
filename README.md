AKK Songlist Website
====================

The files in this project provide a webservice, to store, manage and 
filter a song database - especially the one used for the 
_AKK Ãœbungstanzen_. It has a simple user management already includes,
however it may be better to secure the website using htaccess-files 
additionally.

For the functionality if the different parts of the website, please
refer to the code files - especially to the files in app/songs/
and app/users/. This README only introduced on how to use the 
files in this project.

1. Install the project
----------------------

The project is written in and served with Python, so you will need a 
running Python installation for this. Please use a recent Python version
(e.g. 3.4.3 or above) - altought the project may run with smaller Python
versions (not tested). More information can be found on 
https://www.python.org/.

After you have a running Python binary, ou have to download and install
the project. 

On Linux: The following code snipet will create a new folder, download
the content of this project, create a new virtual environment for python
and install the project with all its environments.

    git clone https://github.com/nils-braun/akk
    cd akk
    virtualenv -ppython3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

On Windows: I have not tested this, but the approach is probably similar.

2. Run the web service
----------------------

After installation, you can run the web service with

    python run.py
    
in the main folder of the installation. This will start the web service
listening for oncoming html connections in port 5000 of your machine. 

You can now open a web browser and navigate to 
[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). There is already a 
user created with the user name test@test.com and the password test.

Feel free to look around and test all features of the service (the play
and download feature however will not work, as the media files come not
with this repository). If you want to get back the original state of the 
database, navigate to the main folder of the installation and do a

    git checkout -- app.db
    
which will reset the database file to its original state.

3. Contribute to the web service
--------------------------------

Please do not hesitate to file an issue to the github issue tracker, if
a feature is missing or you have found a bug. If you want to do some
code contributions, please look into the already opened issue for a
point to start. If you have finished working on one of the issues,
please create a pull request. If it is possible, try not to mix different
issues into one pull request.
